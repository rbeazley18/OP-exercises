# OP-exercises
This repo is a collection of practice excercises from The Odin Project. This site is an amazing free resource for aspiring developers, and it has been invaluable to my learning process. The Javascript pathway starts with the basics and takes you all the way through building with tools such as React, Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. I discovered it when making the switch from Python/Django to Javascript/React, after originally feeling lost and intimidated by JS. I highly recommend this site for new developers looking to drill down the fundamentals of Javascript, and the course also helped me gain a much better understanding of how the internet works and the building blocks of websites.
